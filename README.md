## Project Overview
Predicting the temperature and battery percentage of an EV in use. This project aims to analyze and predict the heating data of electric vehicle (EV) batteries during real driving cycles. The goal is to develop models that can accurately predict the temperature and state of charge (SOC) of EV batteries, which are critical for the efficiency and safety of EVs.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used for this project contains real-life data on an electric vehicle battery, including various features such as temperature, voltage, current, and SOC during different driving cycles. This dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed recordings of battery parameters over time.
